# Create a project called tractorlink
django-admin startproject tractorlink

# Change directory to the project folder
cd tractorlink

# Create an app called farm
python manage.py startapp farm

Next, you need to define the models for your app. Models are the data structures that represent the entities and relationships in your web application. For example, you may have models for farmers, tractors, leases, locations, etc. You can define your models in the models.py file of your app. Here is an example of how you can define some basic models:

# Import the Django models module
from django.db import models

# Define a model for farmers
class Farmer(models.Model):
    # A farmer has a name, a phone number, and a location
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    phone = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    location = models.ForeignKey('Location', on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    # A string representation of a farmer object
    def _str_(self):
        return self.name

# Define a model for tractors
class Tractor(models.Model):
    # A tractor has a name, a description, an image, a price per day, and an owner
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()
    image = models.ImageField(upload_to='tractors')
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    owner = models.ForeignKey('Farmer', on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    # A string representation of a tractor object
    def _str_(self):
        return self.name

# Define a model for leases
class Lease(models.Model):
    # A lease has a start date, an end date, a total cost, a tractor, and a farmer
    start_date = models.DateField()
    end_date = models.DateField()
    total_cost = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    tractor = models.ForeignKey('Tractor', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    farmer = models.ForeignKey('Farmer', on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    # A string representation of a lease object
    def _str_(self):
        return f'{self.farmer} leased {self.tractor} from {self.start_date} to {self.end_date}'

# Define a model for locations
class Location(models.Model):
    # A location has a name and a latitude and longitude coordinates
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    latitude = models.FloatField()
    longitude = models.FloatField()

    # A string representation of a location object
    def _str_(self):
        return self.name
Copy
After defining your models, you need to register them in the admin.py file of your app. This will allow you to manage your data using the Django admin interface. You can register your models by adding the following lines to the admin.py file:

# Import the Django admin module
from django.contrib import admin

# Import your models from the farm app
from .models import Farmer, Tractor, Lease, Location

# Register your models with the admin site
admin.site.register(Farmer)
admin.site.register(Tractor)
admin.site.register(Lease)
admin.site.register(Location)
Copy
Then, you need to create migrations for your models and apply them to your database. Migrations are files that describe the changes in your data schema over time. You can create and apply migrations using the following commands in your terminal:

# Create migrations for your models
python manage.py makemigrations

# Apply migrations to your database
python manage.py migrate
Copy
Next, you need to define the views for your app. Views are functions that handle the logic and data processing for each request from the user. You can define your views in the views.py file of your app. Here is an example of how you can define some basic views:

# Import the Django shortcuts module
from django.shortcuts import render

# Import your models from the farm app
from .models import Farmer, Tractor, Lease, Location

# Define a view for the home page
def home(request):
    # Get all the tractors from the database
    tractors = Tractor.objects.all()

    # Render the home page template with the tractors data
    return render(request, 'home.html', {'tractors': tractors})

# Define a view for the tractor detail page
def tractor_detail(request, tractor_id):
    # Get the tractor with the given id from the database
    tractor = Tractor.objects.get(id=tractor_id)

    # Render the tractor detail page template with the tractor data
    return render(request, 'tractor_detail.html', {'tractor': tractor})

# Define a view for the lease request page
def lease_request(request, tractor_id):
    # Get the tractor with the given id from the database
    tractor = Tractor.objects.get(id=tractor_id)

    # Check if the request method is POST
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Get the form data from the request
        form_data = request.POST

        # Get the farmer name, phone, and location from the form data
        farmer_name = form_data['farmer_name']
        farmer_phone = form_data['farmer_phone']
        farmer_location = form_data['farmer_location']

        # Get or create a farmer object with the given name, phone, and location
        farmer, created = Farmer.objects.get_or_create(name=farmer_name, phone=farmer_phone, location=farmer_location)

        # Get the start date, end date, and total cost from the form data
        start_date = form_data['start_date']
        end_date = form_data['end_date']
        total_cost = form_data['total_cost']

        # Create a lease object with the given start date, end date, total cost, tractor, and farmer
        lease = Lease.objects.create(start_date=start_date, end_date=end_date, total_cost=total_cost, tractor=tractor, farmer=farmer)

        # Render the lease confirmation page template with the lease data
        return render(request, 'lease_confirmation.html', {'lease': lease})

    # If the request method is not POST, render the lease request page template with the tractor data
    else:
        return render(request, 'lease_request.html', {'tractor': tractor})
Copy
Next, you need to define the URLs for your app. URLs are patterns that map each request to a corresponding view. You can define your URLs in the urls.py file of your app. Here is an example of how you can define some basic URLs:

# Import the Django urls module
from django.urls import path

# Import your views from the farm app
from . import views

# Define a list of URL patterns for your app
urlpatterns = [
    # A URL pattern for the home page
    path('', views.home, name='home'),

    # A URL pattern for the tractor detail page
    path('tractors/<int:tractor_id>/', views.tractor_detail, name='tractor_detail'),

    # A URL pattern for the lease request page
    path('tractors/<int:tractor_id>/lease/', views.lease_request, name='lease_request'),
]
Copy
Then, you need to include your app URLs in your project URLs. You can do this by adding the following line to the urlpatterns list in the urls.py file of your project:

# Import the Django urls module
from django.urls import path, include

# Define a list of URL patterns for your project
urlpatterns = [
    # A URL pattern for including your farm app URLs
    path('farm/', include('farm.urls')),

    # A URL pattern for accessing the Django admin site
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
Copy
Finally, you need to create the HTML templates and CSS static files for your front end. Templates are files that contain HTML code and Django template tags that render dynamic content from your views. Static files are files that contain CSS code and other assets that style and enhance your web pages. You can create your templates in a folder called templates inside your app folder. You can create your static files in a folder called static inside your app folder. Here is an example of how you can create some basic templates and static files:

<!-- A template for the base layout of your web pages -->
<!-- Save this file as base.html in your templates folder -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>TractorLink</title>
    <!-- Load the static files using Django template tags -->
    {% load static %}
    <!-- Link to a CSS file called style.css in your static folder -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'style.css' %}">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- A header section for your web pages -->
    <header>
        <!-- A logo image for your web application -->
        <img src="{% static 'logo.png' %}" alt="TractorLink Logo">
        <!-- A navigation menu for your web pages -->
        <nav>
            <ul>
