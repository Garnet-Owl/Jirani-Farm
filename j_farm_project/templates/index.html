    <h2>Welcome to Jirani</h2>
    <p>Jirani is a web application platform that will link small scale farmers to tractors for lease in their locality mainly from other farmers. The goal is to enable farmers to mechanize farming without the pressure of buying the machines, since only a few farmers can afford to buy tractors outright.</p>
